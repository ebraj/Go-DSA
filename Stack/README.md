## Stack

- A stack is a linear data structure. Operations on stack are performed in LIFO(Last In First Out) order or FILO(First In Last Out) order.

## Applications of Stack

- Used in function calls
- Infix to Postfix conversion(Other similar conversions)
- Parenthesis matching

## Stack ADT

- In order to create a stack we need a pointer to the topmost element along with the other elements which are stored inside the stack

## Basic Operations of Stack ADT

- push() : Pusing an element on the stack
- pop() : Removing an element from the stack
- peek(index) : Value at the given position is returned.
- isFull() : Check if the stack is full
- isEmpty() : Check if the stack is empty

## Implementation

- A stack is a collection of elements with certain operations following LIFO(Last In First Out) discipline.
- A stack can be implemented using an array or linked list.
