# `Recursion & Recursion Function`

### `Recursion`

1. The process in which a function calls iteself directly or indirectly is called recursion.

### `Recursion Function`

1. And the corresponding function is called the recursive function.

### `Base Condition in Recursion`

1. Base case in recursion is the case that is no longer recursion.

# `Direct & Indirect Recursion`

### `Direct Recursion`

1. A function is called the direct recursive if it calls the same function.

### `Indirect Recursion`

1. A function is called the indirect recursive if it calls the function other than itself.

# `Advantages & Disadvantages of Recursion`

### `Advantages`

1. The code may be easier to write.
2. To solve such problems which are naturally recursive such as tower of Hanoi.
3. Extremely useful when applying the same solution.
4. Recursion reduce the length of code.

### `Disadvantages`

1. Recursive functions are generally slower than non-recursive functions.
2. It may require a lot of memory space to hold intermediate results on the system stacks.
3. Hard to analyze or understand the code.
4. It is not more efficient in terms of space and time complexity.
5. The computer may run out of memory if the recursive calls are not properly checked.
