# `Recursion & Recursion Function`

### `Recursion`

- The process in which a function calls iteself directly or indirectly is called recursion.

### `Recursion Function`

- And the corresponding function is called the recursive function.

### `Base Condition in Recursion`

- Base case in recursion is the case that is no longer recursion.

# `Direct & Indirect Recursion`

### `Direct Recursion`

- A function is called the direct recursive if it calls the same function.

### `Indirect Recursion`

- A function is called the indirect recursive if it calls the function other than itself.

# `Advantages & Disadvantages of Recursion`

### `Advantages`

- The code may be easier to write.
- To solve such problems which are naturally recursive such as tower of Hanoi.
- Extremely useful when applying the same solution.
- Recursion reduce the length of code.

### `Disadvantages`

- Recursive functions are generally slower than non-recursive functions.
- It may require a lot of memory space to hold intermediate results on the system stacks.
- Hard to analyze or understand the code.
- It is not more efficient in terms of space and time complexity.
- The computer may run out of memory if the recursive calls are not properly checked.
