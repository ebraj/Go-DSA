## Data

Data are the raw facts, unorganized facts that need to be processed. Data can be something simple and random and useless until it is organized.

## Information

When data is processed, organized, structured or presented in a given context so as to make it useful, it is called information.

## Algorithm

- Systematic-logical approach which is well-defined, step by step procedure that allows a computer to solve the problem.
- Algorithms can be expressed using natural language, flowcharts, etc.

## Pseudocode

- It is one of the methods which can be used to represent an algorithm for a program.
- Pseudocode allows you to include several control structures such as while, if-then-else, repeat-until, for and case, which is present in many high-level languages.

## Program

The implementation of the algorithm in some programming language is called program.

## Data Structure

Data structure is the organization of the data which is needed to solve the problem.In other words, Data structure is a way of collecting and organizing the data in such a way that we can perform the operations on these data in the effective way.

# Other Terminology

## Database

- A Database is a collection of data that is stored in an organized fashion in a table containing rows and columns using a software package known as Database Management System (DBMS).
- DBMS is used to modify, define, manipulate and manage data.
- It is a non-volatile memory.
- It stores data in permanent memory.

## Data Warehouse

- A Data Warehouse is separate from DBMS, it stores a huge amount of data, which is typically collected from multiple heterogeneous sources like files, DBMS, etc.
- The goal is to produce statistical results that may help in decision makings.
