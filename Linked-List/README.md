# `Linked List Basics`

### `Definition`

- A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes and each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
- Linked lists can be of multiple types: singly, doubly, and circular linked list.

### `Linked List Operations`

Following operations can be performed in Linked Lists.

- Traversal : Accessing all the elements og linked list
- Insertion : Adding the new element(beginning, end, at provided index)
- Deletion : Deleting the node(of beginning, of end, of specific index)
- Reverse : Reversing a linked list

### Linked List Time Complexity

- Search
  - Worst Case - `O(n)`
  - Average Case - `O(n)`
- Insert
  - Worst Case - `O(1)`
  - Average Case - `O(1)`
- Deletion
  - Worst Case - `O(1)`
  - Average Case - `O(1)`

# `Types of Linked List`

### `Singly Linked List`

- A singly linked list is a unidirectional linked list. So, you can only traverse it in one direction, i.e., from head node to tail node.

### `Double Linked List`

- A doubly linked list is a bi-directional linked list. So, you can traverse it in both directions. Unlike singly linked lists, its nodes contain one extra pointer called the previous pointer. This pointer points to the previous node.

### `Circular Linked List`

- A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element. This forms a circular loop.
