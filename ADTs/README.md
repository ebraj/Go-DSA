# `Abstract Data Type(ADT)`

1. ADT is a type for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
2. In such type, the operation to be performed are mentioned but not how these operations will be implemented.
3. It doesnot not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations.
4. It is called abstract as it gives the implementation-independent view.
5. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.

# `Linear Search`

1. Linear search is a sequential searching algorithm where we start from one end and check every element of the list until the desired element is found.

2. Time Complexity : O(n)

# `Binary Search`

1. Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array. In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.
2. It can be performed in two ways:

   - Iterative Method
   - Recursive Method

3. Time Complexities :

   - Best case complexity: O(1)
   - Average case complexity: O(log n)
   - Worst case complexity: O(log n)
