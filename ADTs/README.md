# `Abstract Data Type(ADT)`

- ADT is a type for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
- In such type, the operation to be performed are mentioned but not how these operations will be implemented.
- It doesnot not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations.
- It is called abstract as it gives the implementation-independent view.
- The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.

# `Linear Search`

-Linear search is a sequential searching algorithm where we start from one end and check every element of the list until the desired element is found.

- Time Complexity : O(n)

# `Binary Search`

- Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array. In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.
- It can be performed in two ways:
  - Iterative Method
  - Recursive Method
- Time Complexities :
  - Best case complexity: O(1)
  - Average case complexity: O(log n)
  - Worst case complexity: O(log n)
