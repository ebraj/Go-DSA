# `Abstract Data Type(ADT)`

- ADT is a type for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
- In such type, the operation to be performed are mentioned but not how these operations will be implemented.
- It doesnot not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations.
- It is called abstract as it gives the implementation-independent view.
- The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
